## Steps to run and debug
### Installation
After the setup is done, the dependencies shall be installed. So run 
```npm install`

### Docker
Docker must be working in order for the server to be online, so be sure to either open the app on Mac or if using Linux run:
```docker-compose up -d```

### Starting the server
Now all that's left is to run the server and put it online, for this purpose run:
```npm run start```
